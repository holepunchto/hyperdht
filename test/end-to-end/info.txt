The tests in this directory are not self-contained.
Since they depend on outside services (like the prod DHT) they can be flaky.
This means that a single failure of an end-to-end test is no cause for alarm.
However, repeated failures when the service depended upon is available is a red flag.

These tests are intended to be run on new PR's to indicate potential issues with the PR,
but not daily as part of our canary tests.
